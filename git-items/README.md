# jareds-resume-site
A sort of "online resume" for my close friend Jared Davis.
This is my first ever website made without using a tutorial. I am making it for my friend, since he has so many accomplishments I thought it would be cool to make a website that highlights all of them.
If you have any suggestions to make this website better, which I am sure there are plenty since I have only been learning HTML and CSS for about 3 days as of writing this, just let me know :)
