                        The REACH Scholarship program was launched in 2012 as a needs-based mentorship and college scholarship program. The mission of REACH is to ensure that Georgia's low income, academically promising students have the financial support to graduate from High School and attend college. I was selected to be in the REACH program in the 8th grade.
